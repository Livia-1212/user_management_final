# Key Feature Mini Milestones
**The User Search and Filtering feature requires:**
- Search functionality:
    - Ability to search for users by nickname, email, or role.

    - Filter users based on account status (is_locked, email_verified).
    - Filter users by registration date range (created_at).
- API endpoints:
    - Added /users/search new endpoint to router, implement the code to enable the query parameters to accept a variety of search and filter options to give administrators flexibility. 

## Step 1: Review Existing User Management Code and API Endpoints
- Added invited_by_user_id and is_converted columns to app/models/user_model.py to facilitate the new functionalities, the invited_by_user_id will track which user invited a specific user, useful for analytics and filtering by user relationships; the is_converted tracks whether an anonymous user has been converted to an authenticated user. 
- Added a retention_analytics table to enable tracking user retention

## Step 2: API-level Enhancement to Search and Filtering features:
- Update the user management API endpoints in app/routers/user_routes.py to:
    - Accept query parameters for search (nickname, email, role) and filtering (is_locked, email_verified, created_at range).
    - Query the database using these parameters.
